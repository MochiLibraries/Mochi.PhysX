PhysX snippets adapted to Mochi.PhysX
=======================================================================================================================

This directory contains select snippets adapted from [the ones included with PhysX SDK](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX/tree/c3d5537bdebd6f5cd82fcaf87474b838fe6fd5fa/physx/snippets).

Generally speaking little has been done to make these C#-like, instead preferring to have them closely match the original snippets to make it easier to compare and contrast between the C++ and C# versions.

## License

Note that since much of this code is basically copied straight from the PhysX SDK, it falls under a different license than the rest of this repository. See the notice at the top of relevant files for details.
